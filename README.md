# Subreddit Manager
This script provides a way to manage subreddit subscriptions without use of the Reddit API. Easily export or restore subscriptions, clear them completely or merge them with an existing subscription base. 

Note: This script most likely will break upon reddit changing their page format - actual API usage is most likely still the best method!
